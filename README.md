A simple Android Application written in Java to demonstrate MVVM architecture. This application uses the latest and greatest libraries to provide a modern, flexible, and testable solution. Major components used in this application are:

  - [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture) (ViewModel + Live Data)
  - [Dagger 2](https://github.com/google/dagger)
  - [RxJava 2](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava)
  - [RxBinding](https://github.com/JakeWharton/RxBinding)
  - [ButterKnife](https://github.com/JakeWharton/butterknife)
 
In an addition it also uses CircleCI to make continuous integration.
